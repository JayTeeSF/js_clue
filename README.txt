call.js should eventually be added to script.js

mutate an initial brain and have those 3 - 6 versions play each other

TBD(s):
1. automate the game setup (dealer.js)
2. get output from each brain back into a (common) game
3. detect end of game and which player won
4. for each turn we want to supply all the data to the neural network
5. reward the winning brain by mutating it!!! :-o

Thought(s):
1. Use NodeJS (w/o the web-UI) to enable training of the brain
2. store the brain in a JSON file
3. load the bestBrain file using XHR from the server...
